# E-05: JSON

1. Copy the entire `leaders` Array data to the file `data/leaders.json` and format it as valid JSON
 
Bear in mind some of the ways in which JSON data differs from "Object Notation" within JavaScript:
   - Only double quote characters are valid to wrap strings and variables in JSON (vs single-quote and backtick symbols in JS)
   - All property names must wrapped in double-quotes

NOTE TO REVIEWER (ANDY?): Here, the JSON should be written to a separate file (`leaders.json`), but that's not possible with Codepen embedding. Consider what would be easiest here - perhaps just instructing them to write this as a string?
