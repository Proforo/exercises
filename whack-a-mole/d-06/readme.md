1. To seed the leaderboard, create and object literal to represent the data found in the leaderboard table, then store the object as a variable named `leader` just under the existing variable definitions for `timeElapsed` and `missCount`. Including the following parameters:
   - `name`: A String that includes the first and last name of the player
   - `secs`: A Number (which may be decimal) representing the number of sections it took to clear the board
   - `miss`: A Number representing the number of times the user clicked, but missed a mole
   - `score` the aggregate score based on the seconds elapsed and missed whacks. Use the formula previously established to ensure the value is accurate
2. Write a `console.log` message to test your ability to access object property data, logging the following message to the console (replacing the given data with your custom sample data):
   > Ada Lovelace scored 9200, missing 1 in 12 seconds
