# D-01: Intro to JS

1. Create a folder named `js` within your main project folder
2. Within the new folder, create a file named `script.js` 
3. In the project's `index.html` file, add a `<script>` element immediately before the closing `</body>` tag at the bottom of the document`
   - The `<script>` element will require a closing tag as well
4. Add a `src` attribute to the opening `<script>` tag, setting its value to `js/script.js`
5. Within the file, add the following line of code to test the connection `console.log('Hello world')`
   - Check the DevTool's "Console" tab to confirm the correct output
