# Exercise A-02: Document Outline

The page we are developing for the Tasty Taco restaurant will focus specifically on the restaurant's current menu. This exercises will allow you to practice building an outline and then structuring it with HTML, all while laying the foundations for the Tasty Taco website.

## Part 1: Outline

Begin by planning the document's outline given the requirements listed in point-form below. Begin by writing the headings in a digital notepad, or by simply write the headings into a comment block in the `<body>` of the HTML document (`<!-- comments -->), in the order you believe they should appear in the document. You may use symbols or spacing ahead of each heading in the outline to help visualize the outline of the document in a way that's meaningful to you. 

The page will include the following content that will contribute to the outline:

- The name of the restaurant: Tasty Taco
- Three categories of food: Starters, Tacos and Dessert
- Seven different dishes: 
   - Starters currently include: Guacamole and Chips, Nachos, Avacado & Mango Salad
   - Tacos currently include: Chorizo, Chicken and Baja Fish
   - The only desert option is: Churros - Caramel or Chocolate

When planning a new page, the initial stage of information architecture begins by developing what's known as a "content list". This would include the document's heading outline, as completed above, as well as other content requirements outlined by your client.

## Part 2: Markup

After having written the document's outline, consider the structure of these elements and how they would be written as headings. 

Remember that headings in HTML are numbered, ranging from `<h1>` to `<h6>`. The `<h1>` element is used as a primary heading, representing the highest level oof the document. Each subheading of the primary heading will increase the heading level by +1. So for example, all subheadings of the `<h1>`, are created in HTML as an `<h2>`.

In the `<body>` of the document, write the appropriate element types with their content to complete the outline for Tasty Taco's menu page.
