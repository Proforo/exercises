   - Write the list
   - Check it twice
2. Take out the dog
3. Pickup dinner groceries
   - Vegan Chili
      - Carrots
      - Tomatoes
      - Beans
      - Tofu

## Steps

1. Using the list above as a model, write an **ordered list** of tasks to be completed, beginning with the highest level elements ("Complete this exercise", "Take out the dog", "Pickup dinner groceries" and "Mow the lawn"). Structure each task as a **list-item**
2. For each of the above list-item elements with a second level, add an **unordered-list** under the numbered list item.
   1. Add the appropriate number of list-items to each unordered-list.
3. Finally, for items with a third level, create an underordered list within the second level item, under the list items's text

**Observe:** Lists that are embedded show a level of indetenation (typically `40px`) at the start of the line, to indicate that it is nested within a higher level list-item - thus considered a "sublist"



## Additional
- May consider having isolating the "heading" of each of th highest level list items
- Could include some "let's get styling" stuff here to show the item boundaries?
