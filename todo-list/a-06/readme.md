## The list

```
1. Complete this exercise
   - Follow the steps
   - Write the list
   - Check it twice
2. Take out the dog
3. Pickup dinner groceries
   - Vegan Chili
      - Carrots
      - Tomatoes
      - Beans
      - Tofu
   - Taco Night
      - Cilantro
      - Beef
      - Limes
4. Mow the lawn
   - Charge the batteries
   - Clean the blades
```


## Steps

1. Using the list above as a model, write an **ordered list** (`<ol>`) made of the highest-level list items ("Complete this exercise", "Take out the dog", "Pickup dinner groceries" and "Mow the lawn"), structuring each of the tasks as a **list-item** (`<li>`)
2. For each of the list-item elements at the second level (sub tasks), add an **unordered-list** (`<ol>`) _within_ the appropriate top-level `<li>`, below the list items's task text
3. Finally, for tasks that have a third level, create an **underordered list** (`<ul>`) within the second level list item, below the list items's task text

**Observe:** Lists that are embedded show a level of indetenation (typically `40px`) at the start of the line, to indicate that it is nested within a higher level list-item - thus considered a "sublist"



## Additional
- May consider having isolating the "heading" of each of th highest level list items
- Could include some "let's get styling" stuff here to show the item boundaries?
